        <h1>CSS Rules</h1>
        <p>CSS allows programmers to customize styles for different devices and screen sizes. This improves website responsiveness and user-friendliness.
    As an example, the same webpage may appear one way on a mobile device and another way on a desktop PC.</p>

        <h2>@Rules:</h2>
        <p><b>Definition:</b><br>
            At-rules are essentially CSS declarations that teach the CSS how to act under specific situations.  i.e., At-rules enable developers to modify the style or design of webpages based on certain situations.  Every At-rule command starts with '@', followed by an identifier, and ends with a semicolon ';' or the following CSS block.<br>
            <b>Syntax:</b><br>
            
                <li><b>Regular At-rules:</b><br> @identifier (condition);</li>
                <li><b>Nested At-rules:</b><br> @identifier (condition) {}</li>
