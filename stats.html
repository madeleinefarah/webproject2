                <h2>Internet Statistics in Middle East:</h2>
                <p>Internet usage in the Middle East has increased dramatically, from extremely low levels in the early 2000s to comparatively high levels by 2023. As the area transitions from a cash-based to a digital economy, aided by a young, rapidly increasing population, it has garnered substantial worldwide attention.<br>
                    Despite this rise, the Middle East and Africa still have the lowest internet penetration globally, at around 61%, according to GlobalWebIndex. Social media involvement, however, is higher than the worldwide average, particularly in Africa. Year after year, penetration in the Middle East increases, indicating consistent acceptance of internet services.<br>
                    According to Internet World Stats, there were over 183 million internet users in the Middle East as of December 2019. Iran had the largest number of users, followed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq. In terms of penetration, the UAE (100%) and Qatar (99%) led the region, while Saudi Arabia and Lebanon both reached around 93%, followed by Jordan (89%). In contrast, Tunisia (71%) and Egypt (51%) lagged behind. Usage is highest among younger groups: 38% of users are 16–24 years old, while 31% fall in the 25–34 age bracket. Many of these users are students (20%), full-time workers (32%), or self-employed (17%). 
                    Most have a secondary or lower education level, and men are generally more likely to access the internet than women.<br>
                    Beyond adoption, internet speed and performance differ by area. Gulf states such as the UAE and Qatar have some of the fastest fixed broadband and mobile internet speeds, thanks to extensive 5G adoption and excellent infrastructure. Meanwhile, nations like as Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco rely significantly on mobile internet, which has grown from over 130 million users in 2016 to more than 180 million by 2021, demonstrating the region's reliance on smartphones as the primary gateway to the online.
