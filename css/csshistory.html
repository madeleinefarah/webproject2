        <h1>History of CSS</h1>

        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for style sheets that describes the display of a page produced in HTML or XML, including XML languages such as SVG and XHTML.
            CSS determines how components should be represented on displays, paper, in voice, or in other media, and is essential in web programming and design.</p>

        <h2>Origins and Development</h2>
        <h3>Developer</h3>
        <p>CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with notable contributions from Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.  In 1994, Håkon Wium Lie introduced CSS to improve document appearance on a website, which was previously limited to HTML.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>CSS's major purpose was to separate a document's text (HTML) from its visual elements (fonts, colors, layout).  This division made the creation of websites more accessible and enabled online pages to be more readily adapted to various devices.</p>
        <h3>Early versions</h3>
        <p><b>CSS1:</b><br>
            CSS's first formal standard, CSS1, was released in December 1996.  It introduced basic text style, font attributes, margins, padding, color and background design, as well as the box concept.<br>
            <b>CSS2:</b><br>
        CSS2, which launched in May 1998, improved on CSS1 by introducing more complex selectors, position features, media types, and other stylistic attributes.</p>
        <h2>Evolution and Modern CSS</h2>
        <p>
            <b>- CSS 2.1</b><br>
            This version is released to address the errors found in CSS2. It became a W3C recommendationd and widely supported across all major browsers.<br>
            <b>- CSS3</b><br>
            It was not released as a single, monolithic specification.It was divided into modules that are seperated, each one to new features.<br>
            Key Modules includes:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Selectors</li>
                <li>Box Model</li>
                <li>Backgrounds and Borders</li>
                <li>Text Effects</li>
                <li>2D/3D Transformations</li>
                <li>Animations</li>
                <li>FlexBox</li>
                <li>Grid Layout</li>
            </ul>
            This modular approach for faster development and implementation in browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>Key features and Innovations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Responsive Design: </b>CSS3 introduces media queries, which allow for the construction of designs that adjust to various screen sizes and resolution. </li>
            <li><b>Modern Layouts: </b>such as Flexbox and Grid are sophisticated layout principles that make it easier to create complicated flexible and adaptive web designs.</li>
            <li><b>Visual Improvements: </b>Transitions, scenes, and transformations allow you to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces without using JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
