            <h1>JavaScript History</h1>
            <p>Brendan Eich designed the computer language JavaScript in 10 days in May 1995.  
                Initially created to improve website interaction, it was intended to add dynamic elements to static HTML pages, particularly for client-side development.</p>

            <h2>Creation of JavaScript </h2>
                <ul>
                <li>In 1995, Netscape Communications Corporation required a method to make web pages more interactive and dynamic.</li>
                <li>Netscape engaged Brendan Eich to design a new scripting language for this purpose.</li>
                <li>The language was first known as Mocha before being renamed LiveScript.</li>
                <li>LiveScript was renamed JavaScript in December 1995, partially to capitalize on the rising popularity of the Java programming language.</li>
                <li>JavaScript was created to be lightweight, interpretable, and mostly used for client-side scripting that manipulates web page elements in real time.</li>
                <li>The language was immediately implemented into Netscape Navigator, the dominant browser at the time, signaling the start of JavaScript's importance in web development.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>JavaScript's Evolution: Key Milestones</h2>
            <ul><li>Mid 2000s - AJAX Revolution:<br>
                - JavaScript enabled updating web pages without full reloads.<br>
                - Result, highly interactive web apps (like google maps, gmail).<br>
                -Huge step towards modern dynamic websites.<br></li>
                <li>Early 2009 – Node.js Release:<br>
                    -JavaScript moved to the server side, not just the browser.<br>
                    -Developers could use one language for front-end & back-end.<br>
                    -Birth of full-stack JavaScript.<br>
                </li>
                <li>late 2009 – ECMAScript 5 (ES5)<br>
                    -Added strict mode, JSON support, and better object handling.<br>
                    -Made JavaScript more stable, secure, and developer-friendly.<br>
                </li>
                <li>2015 – ECMAScript 6 (ES6 / ES2015)<br>
                    -Major update with modern features: Classes, modules, arrow functions, promises.<br>
                    -Allowed building large, scalable applications more easily.<br>
                </li>
                <li>2016–2025 – Annual ECMAScript Updates<br>
                    -Switched to yearly releases (ES2016, ES2017, … ES2025).<br>
                    -JavaScript becomes a “living standard” that evolves continuously with new features each year.<br>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>JavaScript Increment Operators: Pre vs Post </h2>
            <p>When working with JavaScript, the increment operators ++x (pre-increment) and x++ (post-increment) are commonly used.  While they both raise the value of a variable by one, their effect varies greatly depending on the expression's value.  
                This essay explains the distinctions through actual cases and code examples.</p>
            <h3>The core distinction:</h3>
            <p>The primary distinction is when the variable's value is used in comparison to the increment operation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>++x (Pre-increment): This operator first increments the variable, after which the expression evaluates to the new, incremented value.</li>
                <li>x++ (Post-increment): This operator causes the expression to evaluate to the variable's original value before being incremented.</li>
                
            </ul>
