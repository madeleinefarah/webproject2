        <h1>Latest version of HTML </h1>
        <p>HTML 5.2, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on December 14, 2017, is the last official HTML version released as a W3C Recommendation. Work on HTML 5.3 began afterward but was never completed or officially released. Therefore, there is no HTML 6 or any newer formal snapshot, and HTML 5.2 remains the final standalone version from the W3C.<br>
After HTML 5.2, the responsibility for maintaining the HTML specification shifted from the W3C to the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), an organization led by major browser vendors such as Google, Apple, Mozilla, and Microsoft. WHATWG introduced the concept of the HTML Living Standard, a continuously updated specification that evolves over time to reflect modern browser features, APIs, and real-world web development practices.<br>

In May 2019, the W3C and WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications. As part of this agreement, the W3C stopped publishing separate HTML versions and now works with WHATWG to review and endorse snapshots of the Living Standard. On January 28, 2021, the W3C officially retired its previous HTML specifications, including HTML 5.2, in favor of the continuously evolving HTML Living Standard, 
which is now considered the latest and current version of HTML used by all modern browsers.</p>
